# YouTube-MP4-Converter

This application takes a YouTube video link and converts it into an MP4 video file that is saved onto your computer.

Before you can convert any YouTube videos to an MP4 file, you must enter the path where you want the file to be saved to. 

This can be done by clicking the "Update path" button then entering the path into the textbox and clicking the "Update" button.

To paste a path in the textbox, you have to click "LCTRL" on your keyboard. "CTRL + V" will not work. 

The "Check path" button will display the path of where the MP4 files will be saved to.

If you have entered an incorrect path the program will create a new file where the python file is saved with the path name you have entered.

To convert any YouTube video into an MP4 file, you must enter the YouTube video link into the textbox in the first menu. 

If the you enter an incorrect link, the program will prompt you. 

If the link you have entered is correct, the program will start installing the MP4 file.

The program will stop responding. Do not exit out of the program as the install will fail.

The program will prompt you once the video has been installed.
